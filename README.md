# React-Native-Redux-Tech-Stack

This is a React-Native application in which redux is being used to show the information about new tech stacks around the world.
In this application a user is presented with the home screen showing the list of varipus tech stacks.
And when a user clicks on a particular tech stack a card just bumps out of animation down that tech stack giving the user a brief
of the technology.

The application is designed on React Native and Redux. List View is used in order to enhance the performance. The applications can be used
